-- Andreas, 2012-10-18 wish granted
module Issue481 where

-- Use case:

open import Common.Issue481ParametrizedModule Set using () renaming (id to idSet)
open import Common.Issue481ParametrizedModule (Set â†’ Set) using () renaming (id to idSetToSet)


{- NOT SUPPORTED, because in conflict with "Test case" below.

-- With 'as' clause:

-- open import Issue481ParametrizedModule Set as PSet using (id)

import Issue481ParametrizedModule
open module PSet = Issue481ParametrizedModule Set using (id)

-- Abuse case:

as = Set

open import Issue481ParametrizedModule as as as
module M = as
-}

-- Test case:

-- should succeed:
open import Issue481Record as Rec

open Issue481Record

{- Note: this is NOT equivalent to the following, failing sequence

import Issue481Record
open module Rec = Issue481Record

open Issue481Record
-- Ambiguous module name Issue481Record. It could refer to any one of
--   Rec.Issue481Record
--   Issue481Record
-}
